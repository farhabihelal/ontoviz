# OntoViz

OntoViz is a project aimed at simplifying the process of visualizing ontologies with real time data. Thus the focus is on displaying the Individuals and Properties.

## Overview

Ontologies are complex structures that represent knowledge as a set of concepts within a domain, and the relationships between those concepts. Visualizing these structures can be a challenging task. OntoViz is designed to make this process easier.

## Getting Started

To get started with OntoViz, clone the repository, create a python virtual environment and install the packages.
Finally run the `app.py`.

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
source ./.venv/bin/python
(.venv) pip install -r requirements.txt

(.venv) python app.py
```
